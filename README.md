# Real-Time Object Detection System

This Project aims to utilize the object detection technique to identify the number of objects passing through a pre-determined path in real-time using the webcam as well as pre-recorded video. It employs a pre-trained YOLO model for object detection.

# Project 1 - Car Counter
